# Changelog

## 1.4.0

### Security

- `post-install.sh` and `create-worktree.sh` no longer extend the last line of a `.gitignore` that lacks a trailing newline. Previously the entry was concatenated onto that line (`.env` + `.worktrees/` → `.env.worktrees/`), which silently stopped git from ignoring it
- `dotworktrees_dir` and `sibling_pattern` are rejected when absolute or containing `..`. Because `worktree-config.yml` lives in the repository being worked on, these values could previously place a worktree anywhere the user could write
- Branch names are validated with `git check-ref-format`, and a leading `-` is refused so it cannot be read as a git option
- Values interpolated into `--json` output are now escaped. An unescaped quote could emit a second `path` key, which the calling agent treats as the project root
- `vscode_command` has been removed from the configuration, so repository content can no longer choose a command to execute. The editor command now defaults to `code` and is overridden with the `SPECIFY_WORKTREE_OPEN_CMD` environment variable, which belongs to the machine rather than the cloned repository

### Added

- `SPECIFY_WORKTREE_OPEN_CMD` environment variable to point the editor handoff at Zed, Cursor, `code-insiders`, JetBrains, or an absolute path to a CLI that is not on `PATH`. `-n` and `-r` remain `code`-only, since window handling differs per editor
- `/speckit.worktrees.specify` command for a worktree-first specify workflow: create or reuse the feature worktree before writing spec artifacts, then continue the normal Spec Kit flow from the worktree root
- VS Code handoff guidance for `/speckit.worktrees.specify`: optional `--open-vscode` behavior, configurable `code -n <worktree-path>` new-window default, and explicit reuse/print modes

### Changed

- Repository, download, and documentation URLs now point at `some-natalie/spec-kit-worktree-parallel`, the repository that publishes this extension
- README now documents the recommended response to "pre-hook for specify": use an explicit worktree-first command unless Spec Kit itself can also switch the active project root for the rest of `/speckit.specify`

## 1.3.2 (2026-04-15)

### Added

- README section **Cursor IDE: best results with Spec Kit** — `/worktree`, `.cursor/worktrees.json`, avoiding double isolation with this extension’s `after_specify` hook; links to [Cursor worktrees](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/worktrees) and Cursor CLI
- **`examples/cursor-worktrees.spec-kit.example.json`** and **`examples/README.md`** — starter `worktrees.json` for copying `.env` / optional `.specify` into Cursor-managed checkouts

### Changed

- **`install_notes`**: points Cursor users at official worktrees docs and the new README section

## 1.3.1 (2026-04-14)

### Added

- `extension.install_notes` in `extension.yml` — after `specify extension add`, Specify prints this note when using a `specify-cli` build that supports `install_notes` (see upstream spec-kit). Reminds you to optionally disable the Git extension’s `before_specify` hook for parallel worktrees; full `.specify/extensions.yml` snippet remains in the README

## 1.3.0 (2026-04-14)

### Added

- README section **Parallel agents and the Git extension**: manual `.specify/extensions.yml` change to disable Git’s `before_specify` hook when you need a stable primary checkout; branch base `--base-ref HEAD`; honest note on `after_specify` ordering vs running specify from the worktree root
- Command doc prerequisites: Git extension vs `git` CLI, and corrected branch-creation rule (worktree can create the branch with `git worktree add -b`)

### Changed

- Documentation-only release aligned with Spec Kit maintainer guidance: no cross-extension hook mutation on install; optional future **preset** for worktree-first command overrides called out in README

## 1.2.1 (2026-04-14)

### Removed

- `modifies_hooks` integration (revert of PR #1). The extension no longer disables the git extension’s `before_specify → speckit.git.feature` hook on install. If you rely on a stable primary branch with parallel worktrees, disable or adjust that hook manually in your Spec Kit config.

## 1.2.0 (2026-04-14)

### Changed

- Default layout switched from `sibling` to `nested` — worktrees now created at `.worktrees/<branch>/` inside the repo by default
- Sibling layout (`../<repo>--<branch>`) remains available via `layout: "sibling"` in config

### Added

- `post_install` lifecycle script — adds `.worktrees/` to `.gitignore` at install time (not just at first worktree creation)
- README section "How worktrees stay isolated" documenting gitignore + commit isolation model

## 1.0.0 (2026-04-13)

### Added

- `speckit.worktrees.create` command — spawn isolated worktrees with configurable layout
- `speckit.worktrees.list` command — dashboard of all active worktrees with spec-artifact and task progress
- `speckit.worktrees.clean` command — safe cleanup of merged, orphaned, or stale worktrees
- `after_specify` hook — auto-creates worktree after feature specification (configurable)
- Two layout modes: **sibling** (`../<repo>--<branch>`) and **nested** (`.worktrees/<branch>/`)
- Bash script `create-worktree.sh` for deterministic worktree creation with JSON output
- Per-repo configuration via `worktree-config.yml`
- `SPECIFY_WORKTREE_PATH` environment variable for path overrides
- `--in-place` / `--no-worktree` opt-out for single-agent flows
